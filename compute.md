# Which AWS compute service would you choose to host the processing logic for automating the process of loading new items into an inventory database from an uploaded spreadsheet?
# If you have an application currently hosted in your on-premises data center that needs to be migrated to AWS, and you want to minimize the amount of refactoring needed, what compute option would you choose?
# In a scenario where you are planning to write a brand-new application using a microservices or service-oriented design, and you want to architect the application to scale up or down quickly and lower the risk of deploying new changes to production, which AWS compute service would you use?


When it comes to cost, there are some key differences between Amazon EC2 and AWS Lambda:

Amazon EC2:

EC2 charges you for the compute resources (instances) you provision, regardless of whether they are actively being used or not.
You are billed based on the instance type, the duration of usage (per hour or per second), and any additional resources attached to the instance (such as storage).
EC2 instances are typically billed on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning you pay for the time the instances are running.
AWS Lambda:

Lambda charges you based on the number of requests and the duration of the code execution.
You are billed for the compute time consumed by your code, measured in milliseconds.
Lambda has a free tier that includes a certain number of requests and compute time per month, beyond which you are charged based on usage.
In summary, the key cost difference is that with EC2, you pay for the compute resources you provision, while with Lambda, you pay for the actual compute time your code consumes. Lambda's pay-per-use model can be more cost-effective for workloads with sporadic or low usage, as you only pay for the actual execution time. EC2 is more suitable for workloads that require dedicated instances or have consistent usage patterns.


The pay-per-use model of AWS Lambda makes it more cost-effective for workloads with sporadic or low usage due to the following reasons:

Granular Billing: AWS Lambda bills you based on the actual compute time your code consumes, measured in milliseconds. This means you only pay for the exact duration your code runs, rather than paying for idle time or unused resources.

No Idle Costs: With AWS Lambda, you don't incur any costs when your code is not running. Since Lambda functions are triggered by events or invocations, you are only billed when your code is actively executing in response to those triggers. This eliminates the need to provision and pay for idle compute resources.

Automatic Scaling: AWS Lambda automatically scales your code in response to incoming requests or events. It provisions the necessary compute resources to handle the workload, and you are only billed for the actual execution time. This dynamic scaling ensures that you have the right amount of resources to handle the workload efficiently without overpaying for unused capacity.

Free Tier: AWS Lambda offers a generous free tier that includes a certain number of requests and compute time per month. This allows you to experiment, develop, and run small workloads without incurring any costs. It's a great option for individuals or organizations with low usage requirements.

Overall, the pay-per-use model of AWS Lambda provides cost savings for workloads with sporadic or low usage by eliminating idle costs, offering granular billing, and providing automatic scaling capabilities. It allows you to optimize costs and pay only for the actual compute time your code consumes.
